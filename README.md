AI Ethics and Safety are (_relatively_) new fields, and their tools (and how to handle them) are still _not known to most of the development community_. To address this problem, we created the `Teeny-Tiny Castle`, an open-source repository containing "_Educational tools for AI Ethics and Safety Research_." There, the developer can find many examples of how to use programming tools (like functions, classes, libraries, etc.) to work with and deal with various problems raised in the literature (e.g., algorithmic discrimination, model opacity, etc.).

At the moment, our repository has several examples of how to work ethically and safely with AI, using one of the most widely used languages in the community (`Python`). Our lines of focus are on issues related to `Accountability & Sustainability`, `Interpretability`, `Robustness/Adversarial`, `Fairness`, and `Cybersecurity`, all being worked through examples that refer to some of the most common contemporary AI applications (e.g., _Computer Vision, Natural language Processing, Synthetic Data Generation, Classification & Forecasting_, etc.).

You can also find an _introductory course on ML_ organized by the [`AIRES at PUCRS`](https://www.airespucrs.org/). To run the notebooks just open them in your Google Drive as a `Colab Notebook`, or as a `Jupyter Notebook`. You can also follow our [Python and VS Code installation tutorial](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/teeny-tiny_castle/blob/bbe9c0a77499fa68de7c6d53bf5ef7e0b43a25e0/ML%20Intro%20Course/python_VS-code_installation.md) if you want to run these notebooks on your own workstation. All requirements are specified in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file. Python version is `3.9.13`.

If you would like to enable your GPU to follow our notebooks, you will need to install the drivers related to your NVIDIA/Cuda/TPU/GPU. If you use NVIDIA, you will also need the `NVIDIA Toolkit` and `cudaDNN`. Windows users can find a comprehensive guide on how to configure your NVIDIA card in [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IubEtS2JAiY) (_- by [deeplizard](https://www.youtube.com/c/deeplizard) -_).

In [this notebook](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/teeny-tiny_castle/blob/fa17764aa8800c388d0d298b750c686757e0861e/ML%20Adversarial/data_poisoning_attacks.ipynb), you can learn about these types of attacks.
- Adversarial training is one of the strategies that ML model developers can use to make their models more robust. In this notebook, you will [learn how to perform `adversarial training`](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/teeny-tiny_castle/blob/fa17764aa8800c388d0d298b750c686757e0861e/ML%20Adversarial/adversarial_training_cv.ipynb) (using _FGSM_) with `CNNs`.
- And in this notebook, you will [learn how to perform `adversarial training` on language models](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/teeny-tiny_castle/blob/fa17764aa8800c388d0d298b750c686757e0861e/ML%20Adversarial/adversarial_training_nlp.ipynb) using `textattack`.
