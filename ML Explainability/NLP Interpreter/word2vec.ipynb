    "# `Word2vec` - Embedding Words in Vector Space Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Return to the [castle](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/teeny-tiny_castle).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Word2vec` is a popular natural language processing technique used to represent words in a high-dimensional vector space. It is a neural network-based approach that is used to create distributed representations of words based on their co-occurrence patterns in a given corpus of text.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The basic idea behind `word2vec` is that words that are used in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. So, if two words appear in similar contexts, they should be close to each other in the vector space. `Word2vec` uses neural networks to learn the relationships between words by analyzing the context in which they appear in a given text.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Word2vec` models can be used to perform `interpretability` research on text data/language models by extracting insights from the learned word embeddings. For `interpretability`, embedding models can be used for, for example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visualize the learned word embeddings.** \n",
    "2. **Use word embeddings to perform tasks such as word similarity and analogy tests.** \n",
    "3. **Use the word embeddings to identify clusters of related words.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, we first need to know a little more about embeddings, vectors, and the `word2vec` model, proposed by [Tomas Mikolov](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Mikolov%2C+T), [Kai Chen](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Chen%2C+K), [Greg Corrado](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Corrado%2C+G), and [Jeffrey Dean](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Dean%2C+J), is a good introduction on the subject.**\n",

    "\n",
    "**There are two main techniques used in `word2vec`: Continuous Bag of Words (`CBOW`) and `Skip-gram`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`CBOW` is an algorithm used to predict a target word based on its surrounding context words. The algorithm takes a window of context words as input and generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary of words for the target word.**\n",
    "- **`Skip-gram`, on the other hand, is an algorithm used to predict context words given a target word. The algorithm takes a target word as input and generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary of words for the context words.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this tutorial, we will explore a `skip-gram` approach. First, we will explore what skip-grams are, and finally, we will train a word2vec model with the [News Category Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset?resource=download), availeble on `Kaggle`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**While in `CBOW` we trie to predict a word based on the words that come before and after it, a `skip-gram` model seeks to predict the words that come before and after a given word (is basically the inverse of `CBOW`). The model is trained using special groups of words called `skip-grams`, which allow certain words to be skipped in the prediction process.**\n",
