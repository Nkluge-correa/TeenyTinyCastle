Pickle is a Python module used to serialize and deserialize Python objects, allowing them to be stored or transmitted as a byte stream. \n","\n","However, suppose an attacker gains control of the pickled object. In that case, they may be able to inject malicious code into the object that is executed when it is loaded with the pickle module.
