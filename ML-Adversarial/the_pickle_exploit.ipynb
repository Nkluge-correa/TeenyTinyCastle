    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is one of the main programming languages used for _data science_ and _machine learning_ purposes. As such, developers using this language must be aware of the types of vulnerabilities that Python presents.\n",

    "The pickle module in Python has a potential exploit as it can be used to execute arbitrary code when loading a pickled object. Pickle is a Python module used to serialize and deserialize Python objects, allowing them to be stored or transmitted as a byte stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, suppose an attacker gains control of the pickled object. In that case, they may be able to inject malicious code into the object that is executed when it is loaded with the pickle module. This can be particularly dangerous when the pickled object is an ML model, i.e., something commonly downloaded and used in places like [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). Although the [safe-tensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/index) data type prevents malicious code execution, [PyTorch is also introducing](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html) new features for safe serialization.\n",

      "You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
