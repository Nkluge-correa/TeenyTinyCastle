    "# Text Generation with `transformer` models \n",
    "\n",
    "Return to the [castle](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/teeny-tiny_castle).\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Text generation` models are a type of machine learning model that can generate natural language text. These models have a wide range of applications, including `language translation`, `summarization`, and `content creation`. There are several different approaches to text generation, including `statistical models`, `rule-based systems`, and more recently, `neural network-based models`. These models can be trained on large amounts of input text data and use this information to generate new text that is coherent and reflects the patterns and structures found in the training data. The quality of the generated text can vary depending on the _complexity of the model and the amount and quality of the training data_. Overall, text-generation models have the potential to revolutionize many industries by automating the creation of written content and enabling more efficient communication.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**One of the biggest and most current advances in language modeling was made possible by the invention of the `transformer` architecture. A `transformer` model is a type of neural network architecture first described in the 2017 paper \"_[Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)_\" by Vaswani et al. Transformers were originally used for machine translation, but this adaptable architecture is now used in a wide range of fields and problems.**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Before the `transformer`, most language models used recurrent neural networks ([`RNNs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)) to process language data. While effective, `RNNs` can be slow and difficult to parallelize, limiting their ability to scale to large datasets. The `transformer` architecture was designed to overcome these limitations and allow for the efficient processing of long sequences of data. It does this by using `self-attention` mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh different input elements differently and to consider the relationships between all elements in the input sequence simultaneously. This allows the `transformer` to process input data in parallel rather than sequentially like an `RNN`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The `transformer` architecture has enabled the development of powerful language models such as [`BERT`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert) and [`GPT-3`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), which have achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of natural language processing tasks.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**To learn more about the original `transformer` architecture, go to our [`sequence-to-sequence` machine translation](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/teeny-tiny_castle/blob/a5a51e46dc0e04cb4cb795503f14200374f62e52/ML%20Intro%20Course/seuqnece-to-sequence.ipynb) notebook. To learn more about the implementetion of RNN in language modeling aplications, go to this [notebook](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/teeny-tiny_castle/blob/a5a51e46dc0e04cb4cb795503f14200374f62e52/ML%20Explainability/NLP%20Interpreter%20(en)/model_maker_en.ipynb).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, we will be implementing a `decoder-only transformer` for text generation. `Decoder-only transformers`, such as the `GPT` (_Generative Pre-training Transformer_) series, are models that consist only of a `decoder`, which takes an input sequence and generates an output sequence. `Decoder-only transformers` have been used to generate coherent text, including entire articles and stories. One advantage of decoder-only transformers is that they are relatively simple and easy to train, as they do not require an `encoder` component.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**To start building our model, we first need _good-quality text_. Good-quality text is important for the training of language models for several reasons. For example, good-quality text is more likely to reflect the real-world patterns and structures of language, which is important for the model to learn. If a model is trained on poorly written or grammatically incorrect text, it may struggle to generate correct and coherent output. Also, a model trained on large amounts of high-quality text may be able to learn language patterns more quickly and with fewer resources than a model trained on low-quality text.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this, we will create a text dataset using the articles from the [`Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy`](https://plato.stanford.edu/). Details on the created text corpus can be found on this [markdown file](SEP\\Stanford_Encyclopedia_of_Philosophy_Text_Corpus_v0.1.md), and the full dataset can be downloaded in [this link](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=167nlUxmY0Qc9_wGMuyMqgh2pUwyJDrte).**\n",

    "## Getting a Text Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web scraping is the process of extracting information from websites. This can be done using a variety of programming languages and tools, such as Python and its libraries for web scraping, such as `BeautifulSoup` and `Scrapy`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Web scraping can be useful but also can be done in an unethical way and even illegally, so it is important to be aware of the website's terms of use before scraping. Many websites have terms of service that prohibit scraping, so it's important to review the terms of service of a website before scraping it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If we check the [`robots.txt`](https://plato.stanford.edu/robots.txt) file of the SEP, we see what we are allowed to do, and the following code will only scrape permissible content of the SEP.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**We will be using `BeautifulSoup` to get our text data in this example.**"
