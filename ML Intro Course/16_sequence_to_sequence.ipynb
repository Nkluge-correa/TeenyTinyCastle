        "Language translation is converting a text written in one language (the source language) into another (the target language). In machine learning (ML), language translation typically involves using ML algorithms and models to automate this process.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several key challenges in building an effective ML-based language translation system. One is the need to handle the variability and complexity of natural language, which can involve ambiguous or context-dependent meanings, idioms, and other factors that can make translation difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another challenge is the need to handle the vast number of possible language pairs, as well as the need to take multiple target languages for a given source language. Despite these challenges, ML-based language translation systems have significantly progressed in recent years. They are now used in various applications, including translating websites, documents, and spoken language in real-time.\n",
        "\n",

Transformers were initially used for machine translation, but this adaptable architecture is now used in various fields and problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast to conventional convolutional neural networks (`CNNs`) or recurrent neural networks (`RNNs`), the `transformer` model uses `self-attention` mechanisms to dynamically weigh the input features and compute a weighted sum of the input features. In natural language processing, where the meaning of a word can depend on the context of the other words in the sentence, the model can capture long-range dependencies in the input data more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will show sequence-to-sequence modeling on a machine translation task, which is precisely the task for which the `Transformer` was developed. We'll create a recurrent sequence model (`GRU`) and the complete `Transformer` architecture for compassion.\n",
